Гипотeзa лингвистическoй oтносительности (известная также как «**гипотеза Сепира** - **Уорфа**»)- тезис, согласно которому существующие в сознании человека системы понятий, а, следовательно, и существенные особенности его мышления определяются тем конкретным языком, носителем которого этот человек является.

Business cultures:
1. Polyactive 
2. Monoactive
3. Reactive

> **Monoactive** **cultures** allow the execution of only one case per unit of time. Therefore, representatives of monoactive cultures plan their lives in a certain sequence and make up schedules, sometimes for several months and even years in advance. Once assigned, the event can no longer be canceled. Mono-active cultures are primarily Germans and Swiss. Time moves linearly from the past through the present to the future. They try not to think about the past, plan the present in detail and worry about the future.
> 
> **Polyactive cultures** allow the execution of several cases at one time. Polyactive cultures include Italians and Hispanics. In polyactive cultures, an event can be canceled or moved.
> 
> In **reactive cultures**, time moves not linearly, but in a circle, in accordance with natural natural cycles: sunrise and sunset, the change of seasons. Instead of solving problems one after another, the inhabitants of the East circle around them, like around a lake. They smoke hookah and not in a hurry. In the East, they cannot understand the meaning of expressions: "Hurry up, or you will be late", "There may not be a second chance." There is always a second chance, because time makes a circuit. And even better, if you missed the opportunity - when time finishes its cycle and returns to the starting point, you will be wiser and better prepared.

>The **_Linear-active_** group is easily identified. It comprises: the English-speaking world – North America, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, and Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Germanic countries.
>
>The **_Reactive_** group is located in all major countries in Asia, except the Indian sub-continent, which is hybrid.
>
>The **_Multi-actives_** are more scattered: Southern Europe, Mediterranean countries, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Arab and other cultures in the Middle East, India and Pakistan and most of the Slavs. Though these cultures are wildly diverse, geographically and in their religions, beliefs and values, they can be categorised as a group, as **behaviourally** they follow the same pattern with the following traits and commonalities: emotion, talkativeness, rhetoric, drama, eloquence, persuasion, expressive body language, importance of religion or creed, primacy of family bonds, low trust societies, unpunctuality, variable work ethic, volatility, inadequate planning, capacity for compassion, collectivism, relationship-orientation, situational truth, dislike of officialdom, tactility, sociability, nepotism, excitability, changeability, sense of history, unease with strict discipline

Восточные и западные нации очень сильно различаются в культуре бизнеса.

### G. Hofstede classification: 

Additional source (https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/)

- **Power distance index** (**PDI**): The power distance index is defined as "the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally". A higher degree of the Index indicates that hierarchy is clearly established and executed in society, without doubt or reason. A lower degree of the Index signifies that people question authority and attempt to distribute power.
![[Pasted image 20230920155831.png]]

- **Individualism vs. collectivism** (**[IDV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism_Index "Individualism Index")**): This index explores the "degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups". Individualistic societies have loose ties that often only relate an individual to his/her immediate family. They emphasize the "I" versus the "we". Its counterpart, collectivism, describes a society in which tightly integrated relationships tie extended families and others into [in-groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups "Ingroups and outgroups"). These in-groups are laced with undoubted loyalty and support each other when a conflict arises with another in-group.
![[Pasted image 20230920155851.png]]

- **Uncertainty avoidance** (**UAI**): The uncertainty avoidance index is defined as "a society's tolerance for ambiguity", in which people embrace or avert an event of something unexpected, unknown, or away from the status quo. Societies that score a high degree in this index opt for stiff codes of behavior, guidelines, laws, and generally rely on absolute truth, or the belief that one lone truth dictates everything and that people know what it is. A lower degree in this index shows more acceptance of differing thoughts or ideas. Society tends to impose fewer regulations, ambiguity is more accustomed to, and the environment is more free-flowing.
![[Pasted image 20230920155911.png]]

- **[Masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity "Masculinity") vs. [femininity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity "Femininity")** (**MAS**): In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness, and material rewards for success." Its counterpart represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values. This dimension is frequently viewed as taboo in highly masculine societies.

- **Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation** (**LTO**): This dimension associates the connection of the past with the current and future actions/challenges. A lower degree of this index (short-term) indicates that [traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition "Tradition") are honored and kept, while steadfastness is valued. Societies with a high degree in this index (long-term) view adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving as a necessity. A poor country that is short-term oriented usually has little to no economic development, while long-term oriented countries continue to develop to a level of prosperity.
![[Pasted image 20230920155943.png]]

- **Indulgence vs. restraint** (**IND**): This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires. Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms".
