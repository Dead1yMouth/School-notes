# Verbal communications 

Kinds of communication:
1. verbal - by means of words
2. non verbal communication - avoids words (gestures, mimics, pictures)

More than **80%** of communication is perceived by non verbal communication.

## Principals of verbal communication:

### Language Rules:

1. **Syntactic Rules**
2. **Semantic Rules**
3. **Contextual Rules**

In summary:
- **Syntactic rules** govern the structure and arrangement of words in sentences.
- **Semantic rules** determine the meaning of words and how they are used to convey specific ideas.
- **Contextual rules** help interpret language in various social and situational contexts, considering factors like tone, implied meanings, and cultural norms. 

#### Syntactic rules

**Syntactic Rules:**
   - **Definition:** Syntactic rules, also known as syntax, are a set of rules that dictate how words can be arranged to form sentences in a particular language. It governs the structure of sentences and the order of words.
   - **Explanation:** Syntax helps ensure that sentences are constructed in a way that makes sense and is grammatically correct. It involves rules for word order, verb tense, sentence structure, and more. For example, in English, the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order is a syntactic rule, as in "She reads a book."

The Russian language does not have a strict word order, due to the developed system of inclinations.

The Russian language is called a **syntactic** language.
The English language is called an **analytical** language.

When a language is referred to as "analytical," it typically means that the language has a structure and grammar that relies heavily on analyzing and modifying words to convey meaning. Analytical languages tend to have relatively simple inflectional systems and instead use word order, particles, and additional words to express the relationships between words in a sentence. Here are some key characteristics of analytical languages:

1. Limited Inflection: Analytical languages have fewer inflections (changes in word form) compared to synthetic languages. Inflections can include changes in word endings to indicate tense, case, gender, number, etc. Analytical languages rely less on these changes.

2. Word Order: Analytical languages often rely on word order to indicate the grammatical roles of words in a sentence. For example, the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order is common in analytical languages, where the order of words determines the subject, verb, and object.

3. Particles and Function Words: Analytical languages make extensive use of particles, prepositions, and function words to convey meaning and relationships between words. These words help specify aspects like tense, mood, or case.

4. Clear Word Roots: In analytical languages, the core meaning of a word is often preserved in its root form, and additional words or particles are added to modify or specify that meaning.

English is often considered an analytical language to some extent, although it also has synthetic elements. For example, in English, word order is crucial for sentence structure (e.g., "She eats apples" vs. "Apples eat she"), and additional words like prepositions and auxiliary verbs (e.g., "to," "will," "have") play a significant role in expressing meaning.

#### Semantic rules

**Semantic Rules:**
   - **Definition:** Semantic rules pertain to the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. They govern how words are used to convey specific meanings and how meanings are interpreted.
   - **Explanation:** Semantic rules ensure that communication is meaningful and that words and phrases are used consistently to convey specific concepts. For instance, the word "dog" in English refers to a specific type of domesticated animal, and these rules ensure that when someone says "dog," others understand the intended meaning.

*Semantic* is a science about meaning of a word.

Connotation and denotation are two important concepts in semantics, which is the study of meaning in language. These concepts help us understand the multiple layers of meaning that words and expressions can have:

1. **Denotation:**
   - **Definition:** Denotation refers to the primary, literal, or dictionary meaning of a word or expression. It is the objective and universally agreed-upon definition of a word.
   - **Example:** The denotation of the word "rose" is a type of flowering plant with prickly stems and often fragrant flowers.

2. **Connotation:**
   - **Definition:** Connotation refers to the additional, secondary, or associated meanings and emotions that a word carries beyond its denotation. Connotations can be positive, negative, or neutral and are often shaped by cultural, social, and personal factors.
   - **Example:** While the denotation of "homeless" simply means lacking a permanent residence, the connotations may include feelings of vulnerability, hardship, and sympathy.

Here are some key points to understand about connotation and denotation:

- **Denotation is Objective:** Denotative meanings are generally objective and can be found in dictionaries. They provide a common ground for communication, ensuring that people understand the basic, literal meaning of a word.

- **Connotation is Subjective:** Connotative meanings are subjective and can vary from person to person, culture to culture, and context to context. What a word conveys emotionally or culturally may differ for different individuals or groups.

- **Connotation Adds Nuance:** Connotations enrich language by adding emotional depth and nuance to words and expressions. They allow speakers and writers to convey subtle shades of meaning or to evoke specific emotions.

- **Use of Connotation for Effect:** In literature, rhetoric, advertising, and persuasion, the choice of words with particular connotations can be a powerful tool. It can shape how readers or listeners perceive a message and can influence their emotions and attitudes.

- **Awareness of Connotations:** It's important to be aware of the connotations of words, especially in sensitive or persuasive communication, to avoid unintended emotional reactions or misinterpretations.

- **Awareness of Connotations:** It's important to be aware of the connotations of words, especially in sensitive or persuasive communication, to avoid unintended emotional reactions or misinterpretations.

**Example:**

**Word: "Home"**

- **Denotation:** The denotation of "home" is a place where a person lives, typically with their family or as their permanent residence.
    
- **Connotation:** The connotations of "home" are often highly positive and can include feelings of comfort, safety, warmth, love, and belonging. It suggests a place where one can relax, be themselves, and find emotional support. The word "home" may evoke memories and emotions associated with one's personal experiences and relationships. In contrast, words like "house" or "dwelling" may lack the same emotional connotations.
#### Contextual rules 

**Contextual Rules:**
   - **Definition:** Contextual rules, also known as pragmatics, deal with how language is used in specific social and situational contexts. They include the rules governing implied meanings, indirect communication, and appropriate language use in different contexts.
   - **Explanation:** Contextual rules help people understand the intended meaning of language beyond its literal interpretation. They involve understanding implied meanings, tone, and cultural norms. For example, saying "Can you pass the salt?" at a dinner table is not just a request for salt; it's also a polite way of asking someone to pass the salt.

### The principal of cultural difference.

See last lecture.

### Arbitrary and symbolic language

Я бля нихуя не понял. 
☹☹☹☹☹☹
## Barriers of communications.

### Barriers lead to

- loss of productivity
- Conflict
- loss of resources
### Barriers

- **Cliche** words and phrases. - Cliches are overused expressions or ideas that have become predictable and unoriginal.

- **Jargon** words and phrases. - Jargon refers to specialized terminology or language that is used by a particular group, profession, or community.
	- jargon can be a barrier to effective communication when used inappropriately or excessively, especially when speaking to individuals who are not familiar with the specialized language. It can lead to misunderstandings and confusion.

- **Slang** words and phrases. - Slang is a type of language that consists of words, phrases, or expressions that are informal, non-standard. Slang tends to deviate from formal language or standard vocabulary and is characterized by its casual and colloquial nature. 

### Sexist and racist language.

Я ничё не понимаю, она по конкретике ничё не говорит хз чё писать вообще

Какие то общие  вещи.

### Euphemism

died - passed away
